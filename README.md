KeyStatus
=========

KeyStatus does a very basic job. It acts as virtual LED lights for Caps Lock and so forth. For example It displays a red notification icon with the letter 'C' in red when Caps Lock is turned on, when Caps Lock is activated however, the notification icon of the letter 'C' will go green. KeyStatus also comes with a feature called Active Keys active keys shows a little dialog containing the status of the lockable keys. It will display something like this Caps Lock: Active this text's fore color will be set to green when that key is locked and will change its fore color to red when it is not locked.

Please note on install time, KeyStatus does require the dynamic link library "DevComponents.DotNetbar2.dll", so when you install KeyStatus, this file will automatically be downloaded. But for developers, please use the ShitBrick-Tool to download this file with ease <http://bit.ly/shitbrick-utility>
