{"name":"KeyStatus","tagline":"The awesome keyboard accessibility application.","body":"# Welcome to the KeyStatus project\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\n### What Is KeyStatus?\r\nKeyStatus does a very basic job. It acts as virtual LED lights for Caps Lock and so forth. For example It displays a red notification icon with the letter 'C' in red when Caps Lock is turned on, when Caps Lock is activated however, the notification icon of the letter 'C' will go green. KeyStatus also comes with a feature called Active Keys active keys shows a little dialog containing the status of the lockable keys. It will display something like this Caps Lock: Active this text's fore color will be set to green when that key is locked and will change its fore color to red when it is not locked.\r\n\r\n### How Did This Become?\r\nIt was pretty simple, I was out shopping one day and came across this Microsoft **keyboard and mouse set**, so being me, I bought it. Later that day when I came home I plugged it in but yet to notice, it had no LED lights for Caps Lock etc. So sometimes I would be typing yet I didn't know that Caps Lock was turned on, which was quite annoying. Therefore I decided to develop KeyStatus.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\nScreenshots are coming soon.\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\n\r\nKeyStatus should work on 32-Bit and 64-Bit Windows machines (WinXP and Up). It will have compatibility on 64-Bit machines since KeyStatus is compiled on a 32-Bit machine this means that WOW64 (Windows on WIndows 64) will then obviously be in use.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n*  Not released yet, still under development.\r\n\r\nView the latest changelog [here](https://deavmi.github.com/KeyStatus/changelog/online_changelog.txt)\r\n\r\n## Downloads\r\n\r\n### Application\r\n\r\n* Still under development.\r\n\r\n### Source code\r\n\r\nTo download the latest source code please [click this link](https://github.com/deavmi/iFirmware/zipball/master).\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nKeyStatus is registered under GNU's General Public License version three (GPLv3), your copy of the license can be obtained [here](http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt).\r\n\r\n## Donate\r\n\r\nIf you would like to donate towards this project then please visit [this](https://deavmi.github.io/Deavmi/donate) page for information.\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nDevelopers\r\n\r\n* Deavmi - [Twitter](http://twitter.com/deavmi) / [Send an email](mailto:tristankildaire@gmail.com)\r\n\r\nGraphics\r\n\r\n* Yusuke Kamiyamane - [Website](http://p.yusukekamiyamane.com/)\r\n\r\nTesters\r\n\r\n* Walkman - [Twitter](http://twitter.com/walkman100) / [Website](https://sites.google.com/site/wscripthostsamples/) / [Send an email](mailto:matthewcarter17@gmail.com)\r\n\r\n## Support these projects and campaigns\r\n\r\n[![Support the GNU/Linux project](https://deavmi.github.io/Deavmi/images/support-them/gnubanner-2.png)](http://gnu.org) [![Stop the Hollyweb!
