It acts as virtual LED lights for Caps Lock and so forth. For example It displays a red notification icon with the letter 'C' in red when Caps Lock is turned on, when Caps Lock is activated however, the notification icon of the letter 'C' will go green. KeyStatus also comes with a feature called Active Keys active keys shows a little dialog containing the status of the lockable keys. It will display something like this Caps Lock: Active this text's fore color will be set to green when that key is locked and will change its fore color to red when it is not locked.\r\n\r\n### How Did This Become?\r\nIt was pretty simple, I was out shopping one day and came across this Microsoft **keyboard and mouse set**, so being me, I bought it. Later that day when I came home I plugged it in but yet to notice, it had no LED lights for Caps Lock etc. So sometimes I would be typing yet I didn't know that Caps Lock was turned on, which was quite annoying. Therefore I decided to develop KeyStatus.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\nScreenshots are coming soon.\r\n\r\n## Downloads\r\n\r\n* [KeyStatus Binary](http://blackmesahq.3owl.com/keystatus/keystatus.zip)\r\n* [KeyStatus Source Code (.zip)](https://github.com/deavmi/KeyStatus/zipball/master)\r\n* [KeyStatus Source Code (.tar.gz)](https://github.com/deavmi/KeyStatus/tarball/master)\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nDevelopers\r\n\r\n* Deavmi - [Website](http://blackmesahq.3owl.com) / [Send an email](mailto:tristankildaire@gmail.com)\r\n\r\nGraphics\r\n\r\n* Saruu - No Info\r\n* Yusuke Kamiyamane - [Website](http://p.yusukekamiyamane.com/)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
